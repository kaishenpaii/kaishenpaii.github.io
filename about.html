        <p>Halo Halo de Iloko is a popular gastronomic destination when in La Union. It Is indeed a must-visit, as it is not only a restaurant with good food, but it’s also a place where you can see antique collections housed in an ancestral home. Don’t be deceived by its name: Halo Halo de Iloko is not just your typical dessert shop as it’s definitely more than that. Think of all the best in Filipino regional cuisine, made with a twist. It has been a favorite not only among tourists, but also locals who frequently dine in not minding the long lines just to get to eat their favorite dishes. Another thing that this restaurant is known for is that we use all-natural, fresh ingredients sourced locally. You’d be surprised that we do a farm-to-table concept, ensuring that what you eat is as fresh and healthy as possible. The place can accommodate about 80 persons, but it’s looking to open a new branch soon, still in La Union. Visit Halo Halo de Iloko and get a dose of Ilocano culture through our food! Drop by our souvenir shop too located at the ground floor of the restaurant. </p>

        <p>The restaurant is run by owner and head chef Xavier Mercado, who personally does the prep work for all of the establishment’s menu items. He tries to keep his recipes a secret from everyone except his wife, who also helps out in the kitchen. Halo-Halo de Iloko started out in 2004 as a hole-in-the-wall a couple of blocks from its current location. It served just Mercado’s version of halo-halo. He was forced to relocate the restaurant to his ancestral home because of the sudden influx of people. Mercado has been featured in Madrid Fusion and the World Streetfood Congress for his efforts in local cuisine. He showcased his creation: the Okoy Tikyosko, a variation of the popular deep fried shrimp snack. It’s made with mung bean sprouts, shrimp, squash and other ingredients, fried in a skillet. It looks more like a Spanish omelette than a traditional okoy. Mercado explained that he and his family has always had a strong appreciation for food: “We love to eat. We love to travel. We love to explore. And I love to experiment.”</p>

        <p>In the heart of San Fernando, in the blink-and-you’ll-miss-it street of Zandueta is Halo-Halo de Iloko, loved by both locals and tourists for its delicious and, as the name suggests, uniquely Ilocano version of our de facto national frozen dessert. We offer different variations of their halo-halo including regular, fiesta, buko, fried and ginataan. This also includes a seasonal special ingredient like pastillas (December to January), and avocado during the rainy season. Halo-Halo de Iloko will be moving to a bigger establishment at the end of the year behind the CSI Mall still in San Fernando. It will be a village of bamboo houses and a Spanish colonial-inspired building. The restaurant is open from 9 am to 9 pm every day, but is open until 12 midnight during the Holy Week.</p>

          <p>"<br>Place is cozy, old charm vibes. Parking and rest rooms are a bit difficult though. Very good food presentations. Kids love the bagnet and binagoongan. Loved the okoy served with sukang ilokos.The chicken pandan is decent.<br>"</p>

          <p>"<br>Wonderful interior and excellent Ilokano food. The tables on the first and second floor are labelled with the names of the regions in La Union which gives it a charming touch. In general, the interior is particular but not without love, it's like an antique shop and a beach resto mixed.<br>"</p>
